### Hello ðŸ¤—

I am currently working as a research assistant at the University of Washington advised by Prof. Tim Althoff. I graduated from Columbia University with a B.A. in Mathematics and Cornell University with a M.Eng. in Computer Science. After college, I worked as a quantitative analyst in the financial industry.

I am broadly interested in Natural Language Processing, AI/ML for Healthcare, and Computational Social Science. My past projects focused on using machine learning and causal inference in the context of social media and health. I am working towards building a healthy and just web and society.

In my free time, I enjoy looking at magnificent architecture and interior design, learning new languages and instruments, and ((very) casually) playing any sports that involve human interactions.
